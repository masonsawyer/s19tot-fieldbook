## The Guiding Voice 
#### Mason Sawyer 
As I was reading this second section of _Station Eleven_, I noticed how the sentences seem to, despite writing from the third person, mimic the train of thought. This brought me back to our previous class’ discussion about who exactly is telling the story. Who is the narrator? The voice at the end of the world? One passage which stood out to me as particularly ‘thought-like’ was the following description of Viola: “She’d had a different name when she was younger, but had taken on the name of her instrument after the collapse. She sniffled quietly. She was allergic to grass,” (128). This description, which comes on page 128, rather than early on for the purpose of expository explanation of the characters, blends into a description of the surroundings and grass. It’s fluid and thought like in nature. Furthermore, the observations made about Viola seem to only be spoken of due to the context: her allergies are relevant because the characters are actively interacting with a large amount of grass. Furthermore, the allergies aren’t severe enough to pose a potential plot point which suggests that there is no _inherent_ need for the reader to know as much and that the observations exist for their own sake, as a window into the mind of the narrative voice. 

I don’t have an answer for who the potential voice could be. Last class, someone suggested it could be François Diallo. That seems to be the most likely character assumption. Or potentially the narrator comes from a separate universe, befitting August’s theories and is simply watching the story unfold. However, I lean toward assuming that the narrator is an omnipotent semi-character which falls into the realm of post-modernist tradition. As we read further I look forward to learning more.
