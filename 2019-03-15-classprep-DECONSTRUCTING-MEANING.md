## Deconstructing Meaning 
#### Mason Sawyer

Sentence structure seems to be an ever evolving mystery of best usage. Perhaps on a spectrum of ‘good’ sentence forms there would be on one end the concise sentence, and at the other the complex (though not a run on, never a run on) sentence. This is roughly how I’ve come to think of writing both for academic work and personal: a necessary mix of the two in order to avoid a paragraph reading as overly brief or too flowery. However, reading “The Beauty of Code” I was intrigued by the idea that a medium’s “virtues” might be “brevity [and] reusability” rather than aggressive individuality. This idea seemed alien, the notion of writing a language in which it is essential that “each small part is coherent, singular in its purpose, and although all these small sections fit together like the pieces of a complex mosaic, they come apart easily when one element needs to be changed or replaced,” (Chandra). This idea seems inherently opposed to the notion of traditional writing, which though also twin in the need for coherence, lacks the breakability of code, due to to the need to feed into a larger meaning. 

However, my opinion of such changed as I began to look at the bots in the Collection of Bots such as the poem.exe bot. It was then that I began to better comprehend that if one more greatly abstracted one’s notion of a ‘complete’ sentence, then prose and code were not so different. While it’s accurate that changing the parts of a sentence may alter its meaning, like changing a variable in code they don’t alter the function: the sentence still works, the meaning just may seem skewed. Rather than there being any actual issue with the sentence, the complication is in our perceived meaning. 


One could argue that the meaning  of a sentence is its output, the end result of the prosaic code. Reading “The Route of a Text Message” I was struck by how similar the discussion of all the different small parts which comprise a simply text message resemble the intricacies of the early printing presses. Both are a means of communication which on their surface seem like simple facets of everyday life; however, when looked into further, it becomes clear that the processes making up such are in face hundreds of minute factors coming together to create a whole. 

This has led me to think that perhaps code and prose are not so different in their output and methods. Both seek to create an end product which has some greater meaning to the user or reader. Both are comprised of many small parts which rely on one another. Even in terms of “reusability” prose begins to resemble code when one considers that the most powerful pieces of writing often become turns of phrase that proliferate everyday life, going far beyond the scope of their original text (Chandra).
