## Beautiful Screens 
#### Mason Sawyer
I’d heard much about _Station Eleven_ prior to reading it as one of my close friends has been trying to get me to pick up the book for years. In reading it I was struck by a few different sections of the dialogue and how they—perhaps more so than any of the exposition—help to depict the state of the world as it is shown in the text. One exchange, early on in the book between Kirsten and Alexandra I found particularly haunting. Kirsten says that she “‘[doesn’t] really remember what computer screens looked like,’” to which Alexandra replies “‘How could you not remember something like that? It was beautiful,’”(13). This conversation feels particularly apt considering our recent conversation in class about the nature of technology and humanity in regards to _The Future of Football._
 
Technology is so commonplace within our lives that the idea of calling it beautiful, especially something like a flickering error message, seems impossible. And yet when Alexandra first sees it she is “enraptured, the screen a magical thing with no memories attached,” (13). The notion of the screen as being an elusive thing causes a level of cognitive dissonance (especially considering that as I type this I use the screen which I see every single day). Even though the conversation between the two girls is brief, it’s telling and I found it to be an effective way to set the stage of the universe in which _Station Eleven_ operates through something other than plain exposition about the events that have taken place in the cataclysmic twenty years prior.
