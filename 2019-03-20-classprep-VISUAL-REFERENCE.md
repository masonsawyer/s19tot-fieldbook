## Visual Reference
#### Mason Sawyer
I was excited to read this first installment in _The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage_ as soon as I learned it was a graphic novel. While I was interested in the content, I was far more eager to see how the text would appear visually. Sydney Padua does a good job of establishing the text's genre visually within the world of graphic novels. If the title did not make clear the text's humorous tone, the exaggerated anatomy of the characters certainly does—é Additionally, the usage of solely black and white with gradation done in hatching and crosshatching helps to ground the work's roots in semi-biography. 

However, as I read on I found myself frustrated by what I felt like was a lack of maximizing the relationship between the content and the visual representation of such. Much of the text is concerned with the machine which Lovelace and Babbage work together to create--the Analytical Engine--which seems to provide extensive opportunity to implement blueprints, sketches, and other visual representations of thought into the text. An attempt is made with a page depicting the central characters working by candlelight below a blueprint of their design; however, when creating a text so concerned with ideation to integrate a clear visual representation of such into the work as motif seems to be a missed opportunity (23). There are attempts throughout the work to blend the line between text and artifact, such as diagrams for Circular Time and 2 Dimensional Goggles, yet it seems to me that the text never wholeheartedly commits to the visual references it tries to show, leaving it in an uncertain third space between humorous cartoon and thought-provoking artifact (41-2).
