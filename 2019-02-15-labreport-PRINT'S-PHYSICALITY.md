## Print's Physicality
#### Mason Sawyer 
 
Since it was first announced I had been looking forward to the letterpress lab. Less so because of a fascination with the press as a whole, but because I enjoy looking at typefaces and the way that they come together to form words when writing, or rather, printing. This is because, beyond grammar, the way that letters come together is a system that upholds our written language. Similarly, the literal pieces of type hold together the words of a letterpress, a system which was hard to envision the physicality of prior to beginning to construct "A Printer’s Epitaph" for the lab. 

Assembling the excerpt was both more and less difficult than I had anticipated. Working with the overall layout of the sort was easier than I thought it would be, and by the end, I was able to select a few different pieces of type with confidence, knowing which section of the sort to reach for. 

On the other side of the coin, ensuring that the pieces of type were laid out in the proper order so that they would be printed with the correct orientation proved to be far more troublesome than I had thought. Additionally, I seriously underestimated the number of en spaces my group would require and after only a few words we were forced to use surplus en spaces. We had previously discussed in class the bulk of material required for printing, but even when reading about it was hard to envision the amount of type required to print even a small excerpt. Seeing the quantity of type required put into perspective the resources allocated to each printed page, especially considering that type used for one project cannot be used simultaneously for another. This reality helped to contextualize the *Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* and the level of regimentation required for a printing shop to take off. After working at setting type, reading about the fact that “Keimer's printing-house…consisted of an old shatter'd press, and one small, worn-out font of English, which he was then using himself, composing an Elegy on Aquilla Rose” was jarring (Franklin 89). While prior to the lab, I had trouble envisioning how type pieces made a font, after doing such it was clear to me that Keimar’s resources were limited at best. 

Knowing such information helped contextualize the idea of printing in the colonies overall. It was all too easy to think of print technology as quickly becoming ubiquitous; however, the fact that Philadelphia only had two printers clearly makes such thought baseless. Instead, understanding the resources necessary for printing illuminated the fact that, for all its affordances when compared with manuscript culture, printing was arduous in its own right. Printed documents, though they were quicker to produce, in many ways, were labor intensive just as scribal work was. Instead of hunching over a candle, printing requires reorganizing a dropped sort, mechanical maintenance of the presses, and moving heavy materials. In this way, printing is less of a jump from the manual to the mechanic, but rather simply a different type of labor required. 

The revelation about how labor intensive print work is also helped to better understand the Lisa Gitelman reading “Print Culture (Other Than Codex): Job Printing and Its Importance.” In the reading Gitelman notes that much of what we print has no reader, saying: "who ever really reads receipts, bills, tickets, bonds, or certificates? Yes, there is writing printed on them, but their textual qualities have become ‘naturalized’...so that the writing on them ‘has seemed to disappear’,” (191). The acknowledgment of the unread nature of so much of what is printed, when looked at in the context of early printing costs raises the question of why? It may be argued that previously, in an age not defined by the internet, with many alternatives to physically printed text widely available, such pieces of now semi-trivial printing had more regular use. It also must be noted though, that this change over is also indicative of the shift in how we view printing as a whole. As we’ve spoken about in class, small jobs were often vital financial holdovers for printers; however, nowadays there’s a movement away from print in order to cut costs. Such a reality complicates the notion of the forward march of technology in the name of altruistic progress. Rather, it becomes evident that many forces alter the technology we interact with, like those of resources, consumer demand, and the overall financial ramifications of change. It’s only in looking back on such gradual movements that we have the luxury of ignoring the context of change, in order to call it “innovation.”
