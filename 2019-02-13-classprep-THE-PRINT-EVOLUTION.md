## The Print Evolution
#### Mason Sawyer

Reading the Lisa Gitelman excerpt, I was interested in how invested she was in complicating the idea of printers. She notes that “’printers do not print books. They print sheets of paper,’” an idea that goes against the book-centric way we tend to think about print media (Gitelman 186). However, it occurred to me that this definition of a printer is much more in line with that of our modern printer. Unless one is extremely ambitious it’s rare to print out an entire book oneself, such is a job reserved for someone else, a "real" printer. In our class we’ve spoken so much about the evolution of print that at some points it feels as though we must exist in some third space: in which printing no longer exists, even though it has merely mechanized. 

However, in Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography when he says he “was employed to carry the papers thro' the streets to the customers” makes one realize that there is no image of the solitary printer, whether that be in the past or present (Franklin). It is easy to believe that a printer is an individual who comprises the whole of a system, especially when learning of Johannes Gutenberg and other singled out figures in the world of print. However, the description of Franklin's time job hunting throughout Boston before moving on to Philidelphia emphasizes the fact that printing both is and was an ecosystem. Rather than a singular printer, it was a web of individuals, a grand machine made of many small moving parts. 

In this way, rather than slimming down print production, or distancing it from the 'human' aspect of printing as Gitelman seems to suggest, modern printing works in much the same way it did when Benjamin Franklin was delivering papers. Even if we use a personal printer at home that printer still requires ink and paper which are made and sold by other individuals. If we have those supplies delivered or a printer sent out for maintenance, that creates a larger sphere of human involvement. Furthermore, unless one is printing something solely for a personal record, most times a printed document is made to be delivered: integrating the mail system as a larger, likely more efficient version of  Franklin's job. It seems as though then, the ecosystem of print hasn't collapsed, but instead mutated to match the changes in technology and consumer demand over time.
