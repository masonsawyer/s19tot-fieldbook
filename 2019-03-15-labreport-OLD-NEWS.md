## Old News
#### Mason Sawyer

In reading the newspapers for our lab, I was struck by how local they appeared to be. I had the opportunity to look over a copy of the Long Island Democrat and the Salt Lake Daily Herald, which, despite the significant distance between them in terms of publication, both had a similar “local feel”. One way the strong sense of place was presented was through the focus on sales and rentals by individuals who took ads out in the newspaper. For example, in the Long Island Democrat, there are is a column of “For Sale or to Let,” which, though briefly comprised of only two ads, one of which describes a property for rent and the other a carrigage service, both give insight into the small scope of the paper. The carrigage service known as “The Subscriber” claims that it “is prepared to receive orders for Carriages of every description, and to do repairing,” (Long Island). While it does note that it may service “persons at a distance” it also states that “all orders will be faithfully executed...the articles carefully packed and shipped from the city of New York,” (Long Island). This description reinforces the notion that the audience of the paper was for local people, rather than a nationwide population. 

The same local-focus may be seen in the Salt Lake Daily Herald through the many ads adorning the front page. On the far left of the page there is a column entitled “Bankers” which features ads from bankers such as the First National Bank of Utah and the Salt Lake City National Bank (Salt Lake). These ads also emphasize the small scope of the paper. Instead of national companies seeking to advertise, there’s an intense focus on in-state banks and companies as a whole, suggesting that the paper’s reach was small. 

The small reach of the papers is in line with many of the newspapers today. Often there are smaller papers with local capacities, who’s advertising focus on solely those with in a state, city, or even town. Additionally, the small-scale model also mimics that of student papers and those based around institutions. However, the internet has somewhat changed the reality of the small paper as often their content may be found online. While the information provided on a local paper’s website might not be necessarily meaningful to someone from outside the community the paper caters to, it is at the very least accessible, a marked difference from the small distribution of these nineteenth century papers. Still, generally the physical printing of modern small papers remains fairly local, similar to that of the nineteenth century. 

Furthermore, the content of modern local papers in fairly in line with that of the nineteenth century. Both are intensely community-centric with only small columns dedicated to remaining up to date on national and worldwide events. This focus suggests that those creating the paper were members of the community, seeking to keep their papers in tune with their home’s specific needs. While one might have wanted to know what was happening in Europe, such news might not have been as profitable or as relevant to readers. 

In this way, the notion of a newspaper changes the concept of what we think of as ‘news’ in the nineteenth century. Presently our notion of news is something much more immediate: instantaneous updates. The entire idea of news 'breaking' implies an ability to convey news as quickly as it occurs; however, such was not the reality of the nineteenth century newspaper. Rather, news in the context of the papers observed during our labs seems to rather mean information which is relevant to the readership, not necessarily factual information regarding the world. This reframes the notion of the scope of the information, suggesting that center of the world was not the largest city or the front lines of a war, but rather whatever was most physically immediate.
