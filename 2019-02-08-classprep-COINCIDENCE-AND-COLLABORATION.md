## Coincidence and Collaboration  
#### Mason Sawyer

Reading this chapter of _The Information_ I was shocked by the fact that there was a time when spelling wasn't a commonly thought of practice. While in retrospect it makes sense that prior to the written word becoming common, spelling of words would be irrelevant, it seems like such a foundational piece of any language that speaking seems impossible without it. Furthermore, the concept of organizing words by anything other than an alphabetical order seems somewhat ridiculous in our modern world where alphabetical order is used for a large number of organizational systems beyond that of writing. 

This blind spot to the development of language I believe ties into the way that we read, a manner which is distinctly removed from the Renaissance ideals of reading which Adam G. Hooks describes in his article. Rather than "reading texts in order to make some use of them" much of what we read is solely for lesiure (Hooks). This makes texts a rapidly consumable commodity, which we don't consider the inner framework of. Just as we believe there cannot be language or writing without spelling, it seems unnecessary to decipher the inner reasoning behind an author's word choice. 

I must admit that I feel like I as a reader tend to lean on the Renaissance version of reading due to my background as an english major and geenral word-enthusiast, the arguement which Hooks showcases can be extended to all forms of media and most aspects of our daily lives. We live in a culture of rapid comsumption. Often were ten steps removed from the food we eat, the movies we watch, the ways we get to work, etc. Because the world is moving at such a hectic pace, the idea of stopping and looking closely at something seems impossible without falling behind. This reality has removed us from the process of creation, allowing us to forget that the media we consume isn't merely brought into existance with a single snap, but rather through a symphony of coincidence and collaboration.
