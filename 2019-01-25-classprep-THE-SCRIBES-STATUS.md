## The Scribe's Status
#### Mason Sawyer

The notion of the scribe and translator as the keeper of knowledge is an interesting one. While reading Brandon W. Hawk’s _Ælfric’s Preface to Genesis: A Translation_, I was intrigued by the urgency in Ælfric’s warnings that scribes should “dare not write any more in England than that Latin has, nor to change the order, except solely when Latin and English do not have one means of ordering speech,” (Hawk). This emphasis on the importance of the scribe's role as the ones “who lend strength to words, memory to things, vigor to time,” seemed out fo step with the origins of writing (Trithemius). In this way, the role of the scribe and translator are equated as the gatekeepers of memory, the ones who decide what is kept for future generations.
 
While clearly, the scribes referred to by both Ælfric’ and Trithemius are working on documents such as the manuscripts depicted in the video “Making Manuscripts,” it begs the question of the changeover between the banality of writing and the revelation of its power. Considering the fact that the first documents created were records and receipts of commonplace transactions, I’m led to wonder when writing became something ostentatious and of such great value? 

I also was intrigued by the acknowledgment in _In Praise of Scribes_ that “The printed book is a thing of paper and in a short time will decay entirely. But the scribe commending letters to parchment extends his own and the letters' lifespan for ages,” (Trithemius). Such an attitude seems unusual when compared with how we view new and old technology, such as the traditional book and the e-book. While the longevity of the e-book specifically has been called into question, that of overall digital work is often referred to as ‘permanent’ (despite its need for upkeep). The explicit acknowledgment of the book's temporality seemed to also serve to delineate a difference between the ‘writer’ and the ‘scribe’ in a way that went beyond genre and was more indicative of quality. While the distinction lies less on the lines of religious writing and translation, these divisions between valuable and common writing remain, often along the lines of the medium as they once were. In this way, it appears that the evolution of writing and its forms has revolutionized the way we write, but not how we feel about those who do as much.
