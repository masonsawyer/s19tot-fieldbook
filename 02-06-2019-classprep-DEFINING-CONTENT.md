## Defining Content 
#### Mason Sawyer 
In the first reading of Amaranth Borsuk’s “The Book,” I was surprised that there was not more discussion of the printing process in the section on _The Book as Object._ Now, I realise this is because Borsuk has decided to place the matters of type within the “Content” heading section. This idea of defining the line between content and object I found to be both tenuous, and immensely blurred, due to my own notions of what a book _physically_ is. I associated the pringting and the printed letters, illustrations, and other marks on a page within a book to be part of its overall form, _it as an object_; however, Borsuk suggests that this, in fact, is a matter of its content instead. Conversely, I’ve interpreted the meaning of said text or images to be a book’s content, rather than how they appear. This philosophy seems more in line with that of copyright law and the “ideas about ownership [which] had developed with  the rise of print as publishers sought to protect themselves against competition,” (Borsuk 97). 

However, upon watching “The Machine that Made Us” I began to more thoroughly understand Borsuk’s intentions. Type and its forms are so easy to overlook in the world of the word processor and Cloud Printing. However, getting to see the intricate process that was printing at its inception—the time and effort which went into crafting the different letterforms and then individually sorting them to form sentences, emphasized the fact that the printing of a book is an art in of itself, as much a part of a text’s content as the words’ meaning. A huge part of arts and crafts as we as a society think of it in the modern day is about ownership: the idea that there are specific creator(s) of a piece. Listening to Fry explain time Johannes Gutenberg took to create each sheet of printing, crafting each sheet one page at a time, works against the anonymity of modern type and printing (Fry) In this way each sheet had a maker, an identifyable owner. The same could be said of later typefaces whch came into being, before the days of scrolling through endless font directories, each stylization letterform had a creator. In this way, the printing of the page moves away from the somewhat anonymous form of the book, and into the content which we consider individual and defining.
