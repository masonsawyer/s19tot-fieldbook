## Memes: An Origin Story
#### Mason Sawyer
It was strange to read the section of James Gleick's _The Information_ and hear a term as colloquial as ‘meme’ analyzed academically. While I had heard of memes in a genetic context and in that of internet culture, I hadn’t considered what it might mean as a concept. I struggled with Gleik’s description of a meme as an idea rather than a physical manifestation of one, partially because of my association with memes often as images. However, as he described memes with his hula-hoop comparison: “when this species of toy spread worldwide in a mad epidemic in 1958, it was the product, a physical manifestation of a meme, or memes,” the overall notion of a meme as an idea made more sense (313). When placed into conversation with our other reading for today, “‘Fugitive Verses:’The circulation of Poems in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers” I began to better understand memes as ideas after the concept of a singular author was dismissed. Cordell and Mullen note that regarding the authorship of widely circulated poems “the idea of a 'network author' helps account for the ways in which meaning and authority accrued to acts of circulation and aggregation....rather than adhering to individual writers...literature must be understood through systems of relationships,” (Cordell). This assertion seems entirely reasonable in the context of literature; however, it raised the question of meme versus trend and trope? 

Aside from memes in the colloquial sense, I struggled to think of modern creative writing with which we are not concerned about crediting the author. This led me to wonder about the ideation of stories and the propagation of the mind with memes that Gleick describes. A major way in which we categorize literature in terms of quality is the reliance upon tropes and cliches—-how ‘original’ is a piece? However, if these commonplace character arcs and plot devices are prolific due to their survival as concepts, we/re again left with the question of origin? Both senses of the word meme actively complicate the modern ideas of ownership, Leading me to think that perhaps rather than these network-created ideas complicating originality, they instead prove that it is a construct of the post-copyright world rather than inherent to creation.
