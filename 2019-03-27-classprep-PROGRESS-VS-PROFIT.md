## Progress VS Profit 
#### Mason Sawyer 

Reading _The End of Books_ I was intrigued by the notion of inevitability with which the characters spoke about the change in print technology. For example the claim that “‘I do not believe...that Gutenberg’s invention can do otherwise than sooner or later fall into desuetude as a means of current interpretation of our mental products,’” (Uzanne). There is a notion that “progress” both as it is referred to in _the End of Books_ and predominantly in our discussions today, moves in a singular direction. That there is an impossibility of simultaneity as innovation is a tireless march forward, rather than an expansion of possibilities. In Uzanne’s universe, the printed word is to be overtaken by phonography, just as in _Farewell_ where the letterpress printing method is exchanged for more contemporary processes. If we look further to the future, perhaps there will be a second _Farewell_ if the _New York Times_ ever ceases to print at all and becomes one of the many newspapers to adopt solely digital publications. 

However, as I was reading and watching this week's class prep content, I found myself bothered by the finality of both the discussions. While I realize that the end of letterpress printing for the _Times_ was truly the last of something, the emphasis on ending which both pieces have seems indicative of the way we think about innovation as a whole. The entire notion of “progress” implies that there is a perfect, ideal form to be strived for. In the case of print technology, or communication of ideas in a larger sense, it seems as though the discussion of innovation is one that moves in a singular direction and presumes any existing technology _must_ be made irrelevant. 

This idea of inevitable irrelevancy doesn’t seem...natural, for a lack of a better word. While, yes, as technology changes and new resources are used or discovered, new methods become available that succeed where others fail, but that doesn’t eliminate the strengths which made the earlier processes important. Moving to newer printing methods likely meant that the _New York Times_ was able to expand and create a wider readership, as well as putting out more product more quickly, or less expensively. However, the notion that there is something inherently _wrong_ with older technologies isn’t necessarily true. They simply play to different strength than newer technologies. Additionally, if one is to look at the source of this “innovation” it becomes more and more evident that this endless forward march of progress is driven by the dollar rather than an altruistic love of creation. Older technologies don’t become functionally irrelevant, instead they aren’t financially as viable as new technology and thus they are forcibly put out of commision in the name of profit.
