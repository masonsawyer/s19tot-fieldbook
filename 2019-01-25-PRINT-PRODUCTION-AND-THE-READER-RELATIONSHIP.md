During our visit to the Northeastern Archives and Special Collections, I became interested in two books in particular.  One was by George W. Pierce entitled _Principles of Wireless Telegraphy_, from 1910. The other was the 1852 text, _Historical Sketch of the Electric Telegraph_, by Alexander Jones. These were two of the more contemporary pieces in the archive, with only approximately sixty years between; however, when comparing the two's page spreads it's clear that printing technology had developed significantly even within such a small window of time. 

Though the two texts are from 1910 and 1852, upon first glance, I was struck by how modern the texts appeared. Both had standardized margins sans the guidelines which adorned early printed books and manuscripts; however, the margins were larger than conventional one-inch margins. I estimated that both books had roughly one-and-a-half-inch margins on the sides and two-inch margins top and bottom. The page numbers frequently referenced throughout both texts, illustrating how integrated the relatively new page number was into the books’ content. Additionally, many of the conventions which we’ve come to expect of a modern printed text were visible: both lacked signature identification and had headers featuring their respective titles. Furthermore, the books were constructed with similar materials: both made of bound signatures comprised of wood pulp paper, rather than linen or parchment. 

Such features spoke not only the progression of print technology but also to the changes in reader expectations. The lack of guidelines below the text and at the margins indicated how far the book had come from the culture of manuscripts. The font, a standardized serif typeface which would not look out of place in an academic setting today, also speaks to the distance between early printed texts which contained font mimicking that of the earlier handwritten manuscripts.  
 
Furthermore, both books are similar in the readers they might have appealed to when contemporary. Both texts are on a similar subject, the telegraph. The books also approach the subject in a comparable way, each is form of instructional and informational nonfiction manual. Both pieces would appeal to the common person, their simple construction and inexpensive materials making them largely affordable. Additionally, the instructional books are likely for laypeople and casual enthusiasts, as the language does not appear overly technical. 

Despite all the similarities between the two texts, there are some marked differences as well. In _Principles of Wireless Telegraphy_, the later of the two texts, there are two printed graphics, figures of the telegraph’s mechanics which are referenced throughout. Despite the earlier book  _Historical Sketch of the Electric Telegraph_ including very similar content to _Principles_, there are no illustrations in the page, nor are there any throughout the rest of the text. The closest the piece comes to illustration is the segmented list as featured on the right page, on which the embellishment only extends to a stylized use of periods and italicized text. The revelation that at one point in time, a technical book might not contain illustrations of the machine it was describing reminded me of the Lisa Gitelman reading “Introduction: Media as Historical Subjects,” in which she notes “The [telescope] and all of its supporting protocols (norms about how and where one uses it, but also standards like units of measure) have become self-evident as the result of social processes that attend both laboratory practice and scientific publication,” (Gitelman 5). The same ignorance of past form can be extended to that of the conventions of the book, such as illustrations to help and explain a complex piece of equipment.
 
The Gitelman reading felt only more topical when looking at the digitized pages of the 1774 book _Nature Printing._ In many ways, the text functionally resembles both _Principles of Wireless Telegraphy_ and _Historical Sketch of the Electric Telegraph._ It is a nonfiction technical book concerned with recording information about a specific subject. Furthermore, like _Principles_ there are detailed images, which make up the vast majority of _Nature Printing_ content. However, _Nature Printing_ is made for a much smaller audience, solely its creator Charles Darwin. Also, the printings of leaves and plants were made by “making an impression directly from a plant by inking a flattened specimen and pressing the inked side onto paper,” (Sims). This book was made for personal use in a singular form, small enough to fit into a pocket, unlike the mass-produced _Principles_ and _Historical_ (Sims). In this way, we see the forebearer to the crisp printing of the early twentieth century in Darwin’s small book. Gitelman’s claim that “the success of all media depends at some level on inattention or “blindness” to the media technologies themselves (and all of their supporting protocols) in favor of attention to the phenomena, “the content,” that they represent for users’ edification or enjoyment,” rings particularly true when examining the pages of Darwin’s book (Gitelman 6). While at the time the process would have been tedious, we as modern readers are content to flip through the pages without consideration for the effort put in. In this way, the mass-produced texts feel strangely divorced from their content: the medium no longer so intricately connected to their message. Darwin’s usage of his books subjects to create his texts seemingly embodies both the struggle to create new print technologies and Marshall McLuhan’s assertion that “the medium is the message,” (McLuhan 13). Though the affordances of printing, such as page numbers and the ability to form an index of references, clearly influenced the content of _Principles_ and _Historical_ in comparison to the intricate construction of _Nature Printing_ the texts appear estranged from both reader and content, in a way that is befitting of their mass-production.
