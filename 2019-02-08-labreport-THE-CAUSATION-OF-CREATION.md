## The Causation of Creation
#### Mason Sawyer
Initially, working by candlelight to transcribe a letter seemed to be merely a fun, gimmicky manner in which to better visualize the lives of scribes. The room lit by solely candles was dramatic and the letters were only two handwritten pages: a task that on the surface seemed to be relatively simple. Years of handwritten exam essays made extended handwriting seem commonplace, benign. 

However, upon closer inspection of my letter, I came to realize that writing from one’s head and transcribing are in fact, entirely different skills. I later learned that the letter I possessed was that of Virginia Woolf, whose handwriting I found immensely difficult to decipher. At the outset of the letter, I realized that I had one of two choices: to attempt to decode Woolf’s half-formed scrawl or to fall back on my training as an art student and mimic her forms. I chose to do the latter, replicating the visual form of the letter, with its content as a mere carry over. I eventually began to better understand her writing, and about halfway through the first page, I found myself able to read many of her sentences fluidly. 

As I worked, the article “Ælfric’s Preface to Genesis: a Translation” by Brandon W. Hawk came to mind, due to its focus on the role of the scribe as a transmitter of information. Ælfric writes beseeches his friend Æthelward the ealdorman that “if anyone desires to copy this book, that he corrects it well by the exemplar, because I have no control if someone brings it to error through lesser scribes, and it is then his peril, not mine. The bad scribe does much evil if he will not correct his errors,” (Hawk). While Ælfric speaks specifically of the role of the translator, his overall sentiment may be extended to the task of the scribe as well. When the responsibility of translating and copying a written work lays on the shoulders of a sole individual the weight of such is great, because to remake represents a vast expenditure of time on part of the scribe, as well as an importance due to the small quantity of both materials to write with and to be written. 

Though I was simply making a poorly written copy of a copy of one of Woolf’s letters I became aware of the reality that prior to printing as we know it, scribes were the means for which a singular copy became many. It seems obvious; however, working by candlelight made me realize that perhaps the change to print was not only a step forward into a world where the possibility for many of something existed but also a step away from the singular. The world was no longer made up of things that existed only in one place until they were copied through painstaking scribal work. In this way, the world became something full of both more and less at the same time. 
 
One form of media which I regularly consume is radio media, especially when I am at home in Vermont. For as long as I can remember I’ve listened to radio shows on NPR like “Wait, Wait Don’t Tell Me,” “Says You,” and “The Splendid Table.” While I do not directly interact with those who maintain and construct radio transmitters which allow the FM radio waves to reach the small radio in my kitchen or car, like the candle illuminating the page they make my media experience possible. In this way, the transmitter is the same as the candle—removed from the immediate action of consuming or creating media, but still necessary for the overall act. 

Investigating the connection between the candle and the written page helps to work against the narrative of a single grand creator, as is easy to fall into when looking back at history through our lense of modern copyright law. Though as Amaranth Borsuk notes came about with the great commoditization of the book in the post-print era (100-1). The acknowledgment of all the different elements which come together to propagate media makes it so that we are unable to sustain the myth that there is a moment in time in which the world was changed through invention. Instead, we’re able to see that there are hundreds if not thousands of small advances which are made in order to bring something into existence, whether that thing is a new mode of media making or simply a copy of a letter.
