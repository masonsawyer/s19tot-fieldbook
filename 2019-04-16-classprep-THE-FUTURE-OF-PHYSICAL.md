## The Future of Phsyical
#### Mason Sawyer
In reading this final section of _Station Eleven_ I was fascinated by the Museum of Civilization and its location in an airport. I found the fact that Clark has taken up residence in an airport fantastically oxymoronic to our present-day notion of the airport. Airports are places of transit, _liminal_ some might say. The notion of remaining in an airport is inherently negative: it is indicative of inefficient travel. Delays. Layovers. Canceled flights. However, the airport begs the question: what does something's meaning become when its function is inherently impossible? No one is flying in the time after the flu has devastated the planet. This, much like the fall of technology, has rendered the airport functionally moot, yet, it remains. 
 
This discussion of changing technology and the notion of something being obsolete is something that over the course of the semester has interested me greatly. The changed concept of the airport in _Station Eleven_ reminds me greatly of our conversations around the changing book technology, which I feel comes back to a difficult core question: is there inherent value in an outdated form? Much of what Clark collects is entirely useless to the survivors. However, it is clear that there is a value to maintaining such objects. This idea is at the center of the discussion over print technology and whether, as tech changes, traditional codexes have a place in our world. 

Unsurprisingly, I don't have an answer to this question. Personally, I prefer the printed book to that of an e-reader. I believe there is something to books which goes beyond their content, a value that comes with their presentation; however, such an argument doesn't take into account financial ramifications and the larger implication of textual books. 

Like Clark, I believe if something cataclysmic happened, it would be necessary to hold onto physical manifestations of past times to aid in their explanation. Which only leads me to wonder more than ever, in the case of texts released solely digitally: how can we possibly hope to hold on to them in any meaningful way?
