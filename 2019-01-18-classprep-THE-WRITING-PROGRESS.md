## The Writing Progress
#### Mason Sawyer
When the history of writing is discussed it often sounds as though writing developed independently from culture. Even though when we discuss a region's culture we often default to the written or oral traditions of a place. However, when the history of writing as a whole is spoken about it almost sounds as though it progressed for its own sake, autonomously from practical need. It was really interesting when Amaranth Borsuk discussed the ways that writing developed out of need, especially regarding materials. When Borsuk described how symbolic writing arose from the Sumerian clay tablets' inability to support pictorial drawings, I was reminded of Marshall McLuhan’s argument that the “medium is the message,” (McLuhan 1). In this particular example, not only is the medium a message, but it’s also helping to create a new medium: “the "content" of any medium is always another medium. The content of writing is speech, just as the written word is the content of print, and print is the content of the telegraph,” (McLuhan 2) Looking at the history of writing as Borsuk does, the progression of mediums appears far less arbitrary when paired with the content created. We saw the same evolution of textual protocol in our recent lab visit to the archives and special collections. Similar to how the writing of the Sumerians evolved due to the affordances and limitations of their medium, the introduction of page numbers in print history is also due to the new possibilities brought about via print as a medium, a structural opportunity not offered with nonstandardized manuscripts. Borsuk's recontextualization of writing's development provides insight into how the different mediums of writing throughout history have influenced the progression of writing as a whole, showing us that since the various origins of what we today know as writing: the medium has always shaped the message.
