## The Influence of Form
#### Mason Sawyer 
This reading of _The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage_ was an exciting one as I found my critiques from the earlier reading being resolved. Previously, I was frustrated because I felt that Padua didn’t lean heavily enough into using the form of the graphic novel as a means of adding meaning to her piece. However, in this reading, there were several pages that stuck out as being excellent implementations of such. One I particularly enjoyed was when Marian became lost inside the Difference Engine (174).  The largest panel is at a strange angle, immediately making the reader feel disoriented. From the large panel, several smaller panels depict Marian struggling to find her way through the engine, connected by confused speech bubbles (174). These bubbles eventually morph into repeated error messages (174). 

I really enjoy this page as I believe it’s one of the times that Padua makes full use of the medium of the graphic novel as a means for creating a more immersive reading experience. By making a nonlinear page which requires readers to go back and start over again in order to experience it fully, we as an audience get to understand Marian’s confusion and frustration. Additionally, the sheer fact that the page doesn’t resemble any of the prior pages of the book, makes us better comprehend Marian’s feelings when encountering the Difference Engine. In creating pages like this, I think that Padua really puts to use what makes graphic novels so special—-they have unique ability to add layers of meaning through both text _and_ visuals in a way that a solely textual piece does not. Similar to references in films or samples in music, by creating visuals with layers of meaning, graphic novels make rereading far more enjoyable because there’s something new to discover with every revisit to a work. Additionally, it allows for different experiences depending on the age and life experience of the readers, increasing the text’s potential audience.
