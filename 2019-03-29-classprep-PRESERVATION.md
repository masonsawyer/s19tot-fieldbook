## Preservation
#### Mason Sawyer
Reading the trilogy of articles for today’s class, I was really interested in the conflict over what we should try and preserve from history and what to let go. As I was reading about the web archives in “The Librarians Saving the Internet” I began thinking about the other two articles and how, perhaps even beyond _what_ it is we decide to save, _how_ we save it will determine its ability to help future generations understand the past. 

I had no idea that there were ways to preserve data via atomic or DNA methods and learning about those was immensely compelling, however, I was left to wonder what level of accessibility those would have for normal people. A similar issue occurs nowadays with physical artifacts that haven’t been digitized. Only those that have a viable way of reaching said artifacts can enjoy them. It is noted about atomic storage that “the entire experiment must be done in a vacuumed space because the metal surface could oxidize if exposed to oxygen; the slightest vibration could disrupt the needle and destroy everything on the surface; and it needs to be done at low temperatures or the atoms would move on their own,” (Young). However, this begs the question: will this be accessible to people in the future? If this data must be created and maintained in such a specific way, how can we guarantee that such technology won’t become obsolete in the same way that magnetic tape is approaching? 

Overall, reading these articles reminded me of the visit our class took to the Archives and Special Collections earlier in the semester. I recall being surprised at how well the manuscripts written on vellum had survived in comparison to the books on wood pulp paper. I am unsure of how much preservation was considered during the creation of these texts; however, it seems to me that often the technologies which are most resilient are those we don’t necessarily plan on needing to keep around. 

I was also struck by the idea that in order to preserve history, global cooperation is required. While many of the examples used in the articles focused on the internet post the 2016 election, when one begins to consider the scope of the worldwide internet it becomes clear that a detailed system will be required if we're to hold onto anything in an organized way (Young). Despite how daunting the task sounds, it seems the me that perhaps it could be a unifying force in terms of international relations. Even if we can't agree on _what_ is to be preserved, perhaps the simple discussion over methods could open the communication channels and make way for a more well-archived future.
