## The Hidden Printer 
#### Mason Sawyer
After getting an introduction to working with the type the previous week, I looked forward to beginning laying out a job in this lab. Returning to the sort and the overall technology required was far less intimidating than my first attempt at working with type. Now that the initial difficulty was over, I enjoyed the opportunity to take a closer look at how the print technology could be used to represent the content my group had decided to set. 

Largely without thinking about the 'why' of our decision, we settled on using 18-point PT Barnum type pieces to set a few verses from Nina Simone’s “Blackbird.” Looking back on the choice, the selection may be partially attributed to the workability of the type. We knew that we wanted to work with an 18-point font as we had the previous class, finding it a good medium between workability and overall aesthetic. It was after that we selected the PT Barnum type. Reading Chris Gayomali’s “How Type Influences the Way We Think” I began to think deeper about the selection. As Gaymali notes, “the aesthetic manner in which [] words are presented can affect the way we read, and the way we think about the information presented.” Beyond contributing to overall readability, fonts can influence the way we feel about the information, a clear case being the tonal-shift caused by Comic Sans’ usage for the announcement of the Higgs boson (Gayomali).
 
The principles of typography are rarely discussed in my English courses, despite all relying heavily on the written word. Rather, the discussion of fonts is brought up far more in my art-based classes, often within the context of graphic design or hand lettering. In both of these cases, fonts are discussed as moving towards an optimal version—an attempt to create the ideal consumer experience by forming letters to best suit the purpose for which they’re displayed.  

This idea, I believe, influenced my group’s selection of type. Looking closer at the PT Barnum font, there are a few qualities I noted. Firstly, there's a diversity of line weight which calls to mind that of a typewriter, while not being so overt about the reference as courier fonts. Additionally, this allusion to the typewriter gives it an overall impression of elegance and survival throughout time. These qualities pair well with that of the piece we chose to set. The song “Blackbird” is an older song, lacking electronic production. It features largely stripped back instrumentals that allow the focus to be placed on Nina Simone’s voice. Such qualities immediately make me lean towards a serif font rather than sans serif. This is due to the associations with sans serif of indicating a level of modernism, one which I believe best emulates the sound of more produced, electronic music. Additionally, the font is innocuous enough that it allows all the attention to be focused on the content of the piece. This mimics the subtle instrumentation of “Blackbird” in order to showcase Simone as a vocalist.

Beyond our selection of a font. The sparseness of “Blackbird”’s lyrics lead my group to rely heavily on spaces, of which there was a limited selection in the PT Barnum sort. Prior to my working with typesetting, I had considered space to be somewhat of a non-issue, a negative space rather than a positive one. However, as noted in Lindsay Lynch’s piece “How I Came to Love the En Space” space is a vital component of printing. As Lynch notes: “Not only is every letter an object, but every space between every letter is also an object. Every space between words, every space between lines—every bit of white space is an object. When typesetting, a printer has to think about negative space as something tangible,” thoughts that I came to better understand when working with the staggered lines of a song. My group found that we would need to accommodate the differing line lengths by inserting spacers and making sure to keep the type tightly situated. In this way, we became acutely aware of not only the negative space within a vacuum, but how it influenced that of the piece as a whole, both in content and creation. By placing all the spacers at the end of the line, we created a left-justified design that helped to have the piece register as verses rather than prose. Additionally, if we had not properly filled the spaces, when trying to print or remove the type we would have found ourselves in trouble, unable to maintain proper pressure to hold the type together. Such importance makes spaces literally foundational to the printing process. 

Overall, despite our emphasis on printing as physical labor, it seems to me that in many ways it is equally cerebral. Though it’s clear that this distinction comes largely with access to resources. Those who only had a single sort of type wouldn’t have the luxury of choosing between PT Barnum and a dozen other fonts for their verses. However, the attention one affords to the aesthetic and connotative properties of typography seems to be to be the answer to an unillustrated piece of print. Instead of the scribe’s illumination, we have the ability to look through fonts until we settle on Georgia rather than Times New Roman. Such action appears to be the last effort at controlling the impressions of the reader, without breaking the illusions of doing such: a final bid for influence in order to augment a piece of writing without allowing consumers to detect the printer behind the curtain.
