# The Way We Read
### Mason Sawyer
As I read the selection of _How the Page Matters_ by Bonnie Mak, I was curious to see how she would address the issue of typeface, whitespace, layout, and the visual connotations that we as a society have placed upon such optical reading cues. Mak's mention of the fact "that specific letterforms can infuse a text with social or political suggestion," brought to mind a book on typography I read over the summer by Simon Garfield called _Just My Type._ Garfield's book discussed how we as readers make subtle judgments of text based upon the typefaces we encounter. Since reading it, I often think about the connotations of different fonts when I read a piece. Upon further introspection, I have realized that I too associate serif type with scholarly works and formal pieces, while sans serif reads as modern and edgy. Though Mak's piece made brief mentions of typography and the way that we interact with the modern forms of text, I feel like the chapter might have been more successful overall if those were discussed more and contrasted with the details of the papyrus scrolls' and the other textual formations mentioned.

Additionally, I enjoyed the fact that Mak's work didn't diminish the modern forms of writing but instead emphasized the fact that the means of writing we as humans employ simply reflects the context the words were written, saying: "The page has borne witness to this rich exchange for centuries, and will continue to do so for many more," (21). Often, pieces which dissect writing modes of past eras with those of the modern-day seem to view contemporary digital works as harbingers of the death of valued literacy. The detail provided in Mak's description of the papyrus scrolls' production gave insight intohow much time was put into creating writing Materials. In a world of college English assignments, affordances such as printer paper and a wordprocessor are easy to take for granted. As this is a single chapter of a larger work, I would be interested to read more on how the techniques of writing progressed through time. A comparison on how the attitudes of readers and writers changed as the time associated with the creation of materials and ease of access to such would also be interesting. As Mak inferred, while a page's structure alters how we view its content, the context in which said page was created does the same.
