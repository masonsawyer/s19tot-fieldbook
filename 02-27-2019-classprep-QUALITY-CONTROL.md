## Quality Control 
#### Mason Sawyer

Whenever required to do outside research for an essay or project, instructors are certain to highlight the fact that beyond websites, _physical books_ make an excellent source of information to draw from. There exists now the thought that if something is printed, there is at least some standard of correctness that the contents are held to. Thus, I was amused by the assertion that adults should be wary of letting children read printed books willy-nilly as “there is a disposition in early life to regard what is _printed in books_ as certainly correct. Consequently, ideas drawn from that source, are likely to be adopted by the youthful reader, before his mind has been accustomed to reflect, compare, reason, and judge for himself,” (“On Novel Reading”). Additionally, the notion that reading could be a harmful activity for children, seems somewhat alien, considering the many summer reading programs created in order to encourage such scholarly behavior.  
    
Upon further thought, this fear is a spectacular display of historical, or perhaps social, repetition. Just as today we scorn the e-book and websites as containing harmful misinformation, the same skepticism was at the forefront of minds after the print revolution. As Anna Worth notes in “When Novels Were Bad for You” times have changed, but attitudes toward new technology haven’t: “When people bemoan the alleged ill effects of reading online, they often hold up reading a good novel as the more wholesome alternative. But a few hundred years ago, novels were the suspect medium, accused of leading people astray and ruining them for real life.” 

Indeed, the idea that to read voraciously was like consuming junk-food-—“ It is true, the food is light; but it occupies the mental faculties, for the time, in fruitless efforts, and operates to exclude food of a better quality,”—-seems only to further the idea that it is actual harmful to consume poor quality media (“Devouring Books). This left me wondering, is there truly any issue with consuming low-quality media. Reports of “a dangerous disease appeared to afflict the young, which some diagnosed as reading addiction and others as reading rage, reading fever, reading mania or reading lust,” certainly make it sound grave; however, such an idea seems false, not only for the obvious reason that reading generally does not induce death (Frank Furedi). I believe Katy Waldman’s notion of “reading insecurity,” which pops up between generations goes far beyond the actual act of reading but instead is a matter of what we consider quality (Worth). The issue with reading in the 1800s, same as the worry over e-books today, is less of an issue of mode perhaps, but rather content—-the fear that there is no threshold, no gatekeeper, to ensure that there is a necessary level of quality upheld. All of this culminatedsin the assumption that young readers, or young consumers of media, are somehow utterly unable to decipher the merit of a piece for themselves. When looking at the argument through this lens it quickly becomes clear that perhaps the solution is not to decide that the best manner in which to control quality. A better solutionis to make resources and education for creators of content more readily available, to bolster the amount of “good” work in existence, instead of blaming the mode in which media is delivered. That, or to trust young people to think for themselves, which historically, is never popular.
