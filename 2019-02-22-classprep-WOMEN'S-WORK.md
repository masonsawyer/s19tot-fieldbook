## Women's Work 
#### Mason Sawyer

In reading the different articles on women in printing, it became readily apparent to me that the “forgotten of women’s past achievements” as Sarah Werner eriterds in “Finding Women in the Printing Shop” was more prevalent than I thought. It was somewhat surreal to read “A Ramble with Mrs. Grundy” and “Women Compositors” and recognize how I simply assumed that women would have been actively excluded from the print shop. However, as is noted in “Women Compositors” a printer’s quality is not determined by presupposed factors but rather “the difference between a good printer and a bad one is rather the quality of mind and the care applied to the work, than in the knowledge of the work itself,” (5). Similar to the way when discussing print it is easy to think of it as quickly becoming omnipotent and making all other methods of writing irrelevant, the erasure of women from printing history is just as often forgot. 

Additionally I found the arguments surrounding pay very compelling as well. Specifically, how a restructuring of the pay system was suggested in order to better enfranchise workers (“Women Compositors” 5). While I don’t know the history around production-based pay, it seems as though this model emulates that of a factory more of a craft. This seems to better fit how we’ve discussed about printing in class, as a laborer's job rather than a craftsman. Furthermore, the image in  the newspaper from “The Illustrated London News” offers an image of women composers that upon my first viewing, immediately brought to mind the women’s work of garment making. 

Overall, the articles made me think about the fact that history, or progress if one is so inclined, is more gradual than we are comfortable with describing it as. It feels like a safe assumption to say that the English Woman’s Journal Company and the likes of Mrs. Grundy were not made overnight. Rather they came about through a gradual process, one easily overlooked. As Sarah Werner notes, in tracing the history of a single book women’s involvement can be seen in “in nearly all the roles associated with making books: a woman wrote it, a woman published it, a woman speculated with it, and a woman printed it.” However, Werner also acknowledges that only two women could be credited had she not done additional research on the text past the title page. This, I believe is indicative of the larger role of women in history, contributing to the notion that women’s involvement is modern. With further investigation it becomes clear that women were involved throughout the progression of technology and the only modern notion is that of its social acceptability.
