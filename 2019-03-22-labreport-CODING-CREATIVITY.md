## Coding Creativity
#### Mason Sawyer
This lab proved to be the most difficult to execute thus far in the semester. Unlike the letterpress labs, I struggled with the technical aspect of this lab, having to redo my work on my bot several times before it functioned properly. I decided to use a simple phrase: “dream a little dream of me,” the title of a Louis Armstrong song, as the foundation for my bot. This phrase was then translated into 'verb, “a”, adjective, noun, “of”, noun.' As soon as I saw how parsed back the original quote was in my bot I was uncertain if it would even be recognizable when using words from Wordnik. After running it and receiving “allocates an unripe snicker of barbs” as the output I realized that I had been correct in my assumption that it would be undecipherable. 

This got me thinking about the process which I underwent to create the simple bot, one which I would argue is not only a creative process but a writerly one. One issue I struggled with was spacing. After I had gotten the lines of code to run smoothly (or, rather, at all) I found that some of my words lacked spaces. It was only upon going back over my work did I realize that I hadn’t put the spaces I wanted to remain no matter what variables were included within the necessary quotation marks. This proofreading of code is the same as the proofreading which I do whenever turning in a writing assignment: looking over the final outcome and seeing what errors I made in my construction of a sentence. Furthermore, creating an intelligible sentence in terms of being able to be run is the same as creating a sentence which an unfamiliar reader would be able to comprehend—-a missing space or altered part of speech changes the output, the meaning, of both. 

Writing both prose and code require meaning-making through small but important decisions. The same can be said for drawn visual art as we saw in this week’s reading of _The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage_ by Sydney Padua. In the same way that something as small as a missed space changes the meaning of a Madlib, the details an illustrator or book designer adds to the visuals of a graphic novel change the reader’s interpretation of an image. A good example of this is when Lovelace and Babbage are speaking with Queen Victoria and Lovelace must rush off to fix the engine. On page 72, Babbage is depicted in casual conversation with the Queen on the upper half of the page, on a white background. On the lower half of the page, Lovelace frantically works, literally beating the machine to try and fix it, and is set against a black background (72). Though the background color doesn’t change the meaning of what is happening in the scenes, it does alter how the reader interprets them on a more subtle level. By using opposite values for the background Padua emphasizes the differences in experience, heightening the tension in the scene. This is similar to how, when my bot lacked the proper spacing, it was still legible; however, the reader’s impression of it would be altered. 

At the start of the lab I was skeptical as to how coding might compare to prose writing or creating art. I knew that there was a similar focus on meaning-making and that there was a desired outcome from creating code as there is from producing any creative project. After trying my hand at making a MadLib bot I realize that coding is similar to creative endeavors in that a small change can alter the overall meaning of the project in a significant way. However, unlike creative work, the minimalism of coding does seem to provide certain constraints that aren’t inherent to other mediums. While a piece of writing or visual art might not require the simplest solution, coding’s focus on output seems to, which I believe is a key reason that it’s thought of as being a limiting medium rather than a creative one.
