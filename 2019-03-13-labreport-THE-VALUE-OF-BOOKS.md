## The Value of Books 
#### Mason Sawyer 

Completing this final letterpress lab helped me to better understand the different textual artifacts that we’ve encountered throughout this semester. As we worked to build out the pieces of type within the frame, I began to think about the sheer amount of material which went into even the small page my group had constructed. Beyond the actual type which made up our selected excerpt, there was the frame itself, the furniture, the spacers—all of it contained within a single job. Such occupation meant that said materials were unable to be put towards any other jobs, making it financially null had we been at work in an actual print shop. Beyond the material consequences of constructing a page, there is also that of the time required to create each. Though we must take into account the inexperience of myself and my group partner, the process of even laying a few lines was lengthy. I can only imagine the amount of time required for the creation of a book’s-worth of jobs.  

Acknowledging the ramifications of the creation of a book helps to better comprehend the gravity of the pieces slated for printing: primarily those considered a sure financial bet. This better helps to explain the focus on practical and spiritual texts. Thinking back on our visit to the Northeastern Archives and Special Collections, many of the books we viewed—both printed and handwritten—were technical and religious books: Bibles, geographical guides, and manuals. At the time I had wondered where the novels were, whether they were simply not possessed by the archive or if they were rarer in the past. Now I understand that, initially, practical demand and certainty dictated the world of printing more than it does in the present day, despite our dwindling publication industry. 
	
The knowledge of what the printing process entails from start to finish also complicates the notions had around consumption of books at the time. Presently, books are common parts of our everyday life. They’re required for classes, read for entertainment, and generally looked over as being a given in our modern world. Additionally, the enjoying of books is now seen as a positive trait—a sign of studiousness. However, it was made clear that such was not always the case in the article “Devouring Books.” Said article noted that those who read voraciously, “ these devourers of books are guilty of abusing nature, to an extent as much greater than those who overcharge their stomachs, as the intellectual powers are higher than the animal propensities,” (Devouring). Beyond simply over extension of the mind, another reading, “On Novel Reading” discusses the real world consequences of reading by describing the fate of a  “young lady of 17, in Ohio,” who despite her fortune in life was driven to suicide by a book she read. 
	
These accounts serve to combat the modern-notion that books are commonplace objects. Furthermore, after experiencing the amount of time required to complete a singular page, it becomes even clearer as to why such a power would be attributed to books. The book represents not only knowledge, but a definitive amount of time and effort put into its creation which might serve as a testament to its importance in the mind of readers. This notion of authority via medium, which so greatly concerned adults at the time as a means of corruption can also be seen as a brand of technophobia which had continued throughout history. With the advent of websites as a key means of distributing information, there was, and still is, much concern about the quality control regarding information. When looking at books through this lens, their influence becomes even clearer—they weren’t simply created for coffee table decoration, but rather were seen as potentially-destructive guiding voices. It is power which I can’t help but attribute to the time and financial commitment required for their creation.
