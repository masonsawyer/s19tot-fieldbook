## The Importance of Form
##### Mason Sawyer 

Reading Annette Vee’s “Introduction: Computer Programming as Literacy” and Ellen Cushman’s “‘We’re Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century’” I became acutely aware of the form of the writing I was reading and how it influenced my response to the pieces. I read Cushman’s piece first and while I enjoyed it for its content I didn’t give the form of the writing any particular thought. It was only upon my reading of Vee’s piece that I thought back to what had made the former article so structurally appealing. 

Looking over Cushman’s work, I was reminded of the statement that’s somewhat of a motto for these class prep pieces: McLuhan’s assertion that “the medium is the message,” (McLuhan 13). However, while McLuhan’s words appear largely neutral, their influence on my perception of these pieces was not. For the first time since starting this course, I had a strong favorite between the classprep works, that being Cushman’s piece. This I believe is because the way the structure of her piece supported its content made it approachable. Upon starting it I was interested in the subject; however, the beginning of her description of the specific syllabary of the Sequoyan language was daunting. Her assertion that “the writing system can represent more than merely sound units: in some words, particularly verb phrases, the writing can indicate entire levels of semantic, syntactic, and grammatical information with each character,” did not immediately make sense to me (Cushman 10). This confusion was reduced by how she broke down the initial complexity of Sequoyan and her comparison that "Morphographic writing systems work by representing meaning with each glyph, similar to the ways in which Chinese works with its hundreds of thousands of characters but combined with the economy of a syllabary," (Cushman 10). Furthermore, the difficulty of comprehending the language structure as she broke it down in school made the experience of confusion and struggle to interpret feel all the more immediate and important. Despite her description of the language taking years to even begin to understand the form of, as a reader the task felt necessary and possible, rather than an aim so high as to be unachievable. 

I cannot say the same for Vee’s piece. Though her argument was similar, both pieces being a case for literacy, her approach did not bolster her argument. While her specific claim held weight: that “because every form of digital communication is ultimately built on a platform of computer code, programming appears to be more fundamental than other digital skills dubbed literacies, especially those associated only with computer usage” thus making it necessary for the future, her writing’s structure seemed somewhat ironic in its frustrating form (Vee 3). Soon after making her initial case she launches into a dissection of the discussion around the name of the skill, _coding_ versus _programming_, and other such intricacies. She also talks about why it's so important for women and people of color to be more represented in the coding community, through the somewhat odd example of a google images search; however, she evidently doesn't see how her own writing imitates the form she's trying to work against. Vee notes that there is a perception of what a programmer looks like in her description of the "'geek gene' mindset—the belief that people are born wired to program or they’re not," (Vee 18). However, it feels as though she misses the idea that one of the key issues with "non-traditional" programmers entering the field is the sense of rejection and gatekeeping which is rampant within the world of coding. In writing a piece that appears content to pat itself on the back for its insightful argument and continuously delve into the intricacies of "CS" versus "coding" and endless explanations of jargon, Vee evidently has missed that her writing is mimicking the form of her content. Or perhaps it's the other way around, that she simply found it impossible to make an argument about coding without wading into minutiae that the layman would find not only daunting, but also as a list of reasons why learning code was too hard, too complex, and too exclusive to bother with.
